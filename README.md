# Book Sale Management System
This repository contains a Book Sale Management System developed as a semester project for our Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. The primary aim of this project was to apply and demonstrate our understanding of OOP concepts.

## Project Overview
The Book Sale Management System is a robust and comprehensive system, designed to manage various operations related to book sales. It might seem bulky due to extensive features and functionalities it provides.

Please note that this project was created at the early stage of our programming journey, just three months into learning about coding. Therefore, the codebase might not reflect the best practices or most efficient solutions.

## Future Improvements
This project holds a special place in my hearts as it symbolizes my first steps into the world of programming. I understand that there is a lot of room for optimization and efficiency improvements in the code. As I progress in my programming journey, I plan to revisit this project and refactor the code, making it as concise and efficient as possible.

## Understanding the Code
While going through the codebase, please consider that this project was accomplished in a span of just two days by a beginner programmer. Hence, the code organization and structure might not be optimal.

## Conclusion
I am proud of what I have accomplished with this project and excited about how much more I have to learn. Please don't judge my programming skills solely based on this project. It merely represents the beginning of my journey, and I have grown significantly since then.

Thank you for your interest in my Book Sale Management System project! I am open to any suggestions or feedback that could help me improve.

Happy coding!
